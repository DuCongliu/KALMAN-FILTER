Algorithms on Analysis of Fault Diagnosis of Electric Circuit

Abstract— For fault diagnosis analysis on a series circuit that consists of a resistance inductance and capacitance needs an algorithm to achieve the goal. Resistance, inductance and capacitance in the series circuit fault diagnosis analysis algorithm is produced using the MULTISIM resistor, inductor and capacitor series circuit containing the simulation of thermal noise signal, and then using MATLAB construct a resistor, inductor and capacitor series circuit mathematical model to estimate the resistance, inductance and capacitance of the series circuit of electronic components parameters of resistance, inductance and capacitance value. Genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal solution of the objective function. The optimal solution is the parameter value of electronic components. The objective function is the sum of the squares of the difference between the simulation signal and the output signal of the mathematical model of the circuit. The error sum of squares made in this experiment is less than 1%. Fault refers to that the parameter values of electronic components are beyond the normal range. The k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm is used to classify the parameter values of electronic components into two states: within the normal range and outside the normal range. Therefore, circuit faults can be diagnosed.

Simplified Extended Kalman Filter Observer for SOC Estimation of Commercial Power-Oriented LFP Lithium Battery Cells

摘要：
    The lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cell chemistry is finding wide acceptance for energy storage on-board hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs), due to its high intrinsic safety, fast charging, and long cycle life. However,three main challenges need to be addressed for the accurate estimation of their state of charge (SOC) at runtime:
     1.Long voltage relaxation time to reach its open circuit voltage (OCV) after a current pulse.
     2. Time-, temperature- and SOC-dependent hysteresis.
     3. Very flat OCV-SOC curve for most of the SOC range.
    In view of these problems, traditional SOC estimation techniques such as coulomb counting with error correction using the SOC-OCV correlation curve are not suitable for this chemistry.
    This work addressed these challenges with a novel combination of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm, a two-RC-block equivalent circuit and the traditional coulomb counting method. The simplified implementation of the EKF algorithm offers a computationally efficient option for runtime SOC evaluation on-board vehicles. The SOC estimation was validated with experimental data of a current profile contaminated with pseudo-random noise and with an offset in the initial condition. The model rapidly converged to within 4% of the true SOC even with imposed errors of 40% to initial SOC, 24% to current measurement and 6% to voltage measurement.
